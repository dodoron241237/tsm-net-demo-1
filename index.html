    <h2>TSM-Net</h2>
    <h2>Temporal Compressing Autoencoder with Adversarial Losses for Time-Scale Modification on Audio Signals.</h2>

    <p>We proposed a novel approach in the field of time-scale modification on the audio signals. While traditional methods use framing technique and spectral approaches use short-time Fourier transform to get high-level units. TSM-Net, our neural-network model encodes the raw audio into a high-level latent representation called Neuralgram. Since the resulting Neuralgram is a two-dimensional image with real values, we apply some existing image resizing techniques on the Neuralgram and decode it using our neural decoder to obtain the time-scaled audio. Both the encoder and decoder are trained with GANs, which shows fair generalization ability on the unseen scaled Neuralgrams. Our method yields little artifacts and opens a new possibility in the research of modern time-scale modification.</p>
